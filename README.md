# soil--analysis-app
this appliction is a machine learning application wich use CNN to train the model, and streamlit to build the application.
this application is soil analysis and monitoring using remote image processing.
Steps:
dowload satellite images, 
initiate preprocess algorithms on those images in order to filter noise and irrelevant datas,
start the model by first off all load a dataset that contain soil informations,
train the model
use streamlit to build application in order to make predictions, view evaluations metrics, view advices.
